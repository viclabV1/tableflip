# tableflip

This is a fairly simple Discord bot that clears everything in a text channel.

If you want to attach this code to your own bot, create a .env file in the repository root folder with the BOT_LOGIN variable set to whatever your bot token is.

If you just want to use my bot, go ahead and use this link to let the bot in:

COMMANDS:

!tableflip : [ADMINISTRATOR ONLY] This will delete everything in a channel by making a copy of the channel and deleting the original. 

!nuclear : [ADMINISTRATOR ONLY] This will delete the channel itself.

amogus : This one is just stupid.
